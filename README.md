- 👋 Hi, I’m @Darkheadbanger
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end and Back-end development 
- 🌱 On the Front-end, I'm currently learning JavaScript,  TypeScript, Vue.js, Angular, and nestJS 🚀
- 💼 On the Back-end, I'm delving into Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MongoDB, MySQL, SQL, nestJS, and NoSQL.
- 🌟 I'm especially eager to master nestJS and Angular as I wish to specialize in them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging and interesting web development projects
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbouhaben/)
- 😊 Always open to connect, learn, and grow!
